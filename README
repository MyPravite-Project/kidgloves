KidGloves Rack Handler
======================

The worlds gentlest handler.

Why?  Oh God why?

I'll tell you why.  Because I couldn't get web server to run in MacRuby, even 
though Rack will.  Which is stupid.  So I made the simplest pure-ruby server
I could think of that also has a Rack handler - which in this case is the same
class.  The handler is a server itself.

Now I can test my Rack apps in MacRuby and then re-use the methods that I know
now properly work in a iPhone app with CocoaHTTPServer or something.  The Rack
apps won't, obviously, but the methods I call in them will.  It's complicated.
